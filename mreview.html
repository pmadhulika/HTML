<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
   <ul>
    <li>Meera is the only character seen on screen throughout the film, could be any young girl with hopes and dreams. </li>
    <br><li>The minute detail regarding the characters on the other side was stunningly presented.</li>
    <br><li>The entire film runs on phone conversations and we get to hear Meera's fiancee Kalyan,<br> Meera's parents and in-laws, police officials, goons, tailor, and many other characters.</li></ul>
   
   </ul>
   <strong>Plus Points</strong>
   <ul>
    <li>Gargeyi, as Meera, did an impressive job carrying the whole film on her shoulders, portraying the nuances of a girl <br> who is about  to get married the next day and as a worried soul who gets embroiled in a nasty police case.</li>
    <li>The first half has some good moments, and the film moves at a decent pace during this hour.</li>
    <li> The sound effects and the camera angles should be highly superior for a viewer to connect to the movie,Hello Meera gets it right in these aspects.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Minus Points</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Most part of the story gets completed in the first half, and there is nothing much that happens in the second hour plotwise.</li>
    <li>The thrill element, which was maintained in the first half, gets bogged down towards the climax.</li>
</ul>
